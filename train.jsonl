How many cookies will each friend get?"},{"role":"user","content":"I understand that part, but what if I want to share them among 3 friends instead?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Let's stick with the visual representation. Imagine you have 10 cookies, but now you want to share them among 3 friends. How many cookies will each friend get?"},{"role":"user","content":"Okay, I think I get it now. So, I would divide the cookies into 3 equal parts, and each friend would get one part?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, you've got it! Remember, when dividing something equally among a group of people, we find the total number of parts by multiplying the number of people by the number of equal parts each person gets. In this case, we multiply 3 (number of friends) by 1 (equal part for each friend) to get 3 total parts.
